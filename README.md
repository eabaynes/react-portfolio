# React Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio website built with React. It is a simple, single page application that shows you some basic information about me, my work, and how to contact me. It also has a contact form for you to send me a message. Right now the contact form is not connected to my email, but I plan to add that functionality in the future. For now, you can send me a message through LinkedIn or GitHub! Thank you for visiting my portfolio!

## Installation

If you'd like to install and view this page locally, you can clone the repository to your local machine. Then, in the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project and run `npm install`. Once the dependencies have been installed, run `npm start` to start the server. The page should open in your browser automatically, but if it doesn't, you can navigate to `localhost:5173` in your browser to view the page.
