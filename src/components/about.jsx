          I'm a former Chef turned Web Developer! After 10 years cooking, I
          decided it was time for a change so I can better manage my health and
          future. I love to learn, and wound up turning to the world of
          technology for my next career adventure. My interests lie mostly in
          front-end development and user experience, but I have done back-end
          development as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience in the hospitality industry has given me a strong set of
          soft skills including communication, teamwork, and problem solving.
          I'm no stranger to hard work and environments that require
          adaptability and flexibility. While I'm no longer a professional Chef,
          I still love to cook and share my creations with friends and
          coworkers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently seeking a full-time position as a Front End Developer
          where I can continue to sharpen my skills and grow as a developer. My
          long term goal is to learn more languages and skills, and eventually
          become a UX/UI designer with the ability to contribute to the
          development process.
